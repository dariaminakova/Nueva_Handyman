            <figure class='feedbackInfo'>“Peter has done several small and 
                large projects for my old Victorian home on Grove Street. 
                He’s always incredibly professional and accommodating. 
                I know I can trust him to work diligently even when 
                I’m away on vacation.”

            <figure class='feedbackInfo'>“People have been complimenting 
                my bathroom nonstop since Peter remodeled it three years ago. 
                Everything’s still got that new sheen and the tilework is just awesome.”

            <figure class='feedbackInfo'>“I’ve been hiring the Sweeneys 
                since I first moved into my house over 70 years ago. 
                They did my kitchen cabinets, fixed my drains, and even 
                rewired the lights in my bedroom into a single switch! 
                There’s nothing the Sweeney’s can’t do.”

            <figure class='feedbackInfo'>“I had this toilet that 
                always had a problem. Either it was a leak or a plug. 
                It was always giving me a headache. I’d hired other 
                plumbers in the neighborhood, but problems would 
                always come back. Since Peter worked on it last 
                year, it’s been working perfectly. I’m so grateful!”

            <h5>MY NAME IS PETER</h5>
            <p class='contentInfo'>I started apprenticing 
                for my dad, Peter Sweeney, Jr. when 
                I was twelve, but even before that 
                I was watching him work all the time. 
                My grandpa established our company in 1918, 
                back when we specialized in carpentry and woodwork. 
                Dad picked up new trades and expanded our business. 
                I’ve been servicing the greater Wichita area for 
                over 15 years and am about to bring my oldest 
                son in as an assistant.</p>
